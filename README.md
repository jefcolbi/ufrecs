# Ultra-Fraud-Resistant Electoral Control System

UFRECS a.k.a is an electoral control system built to be ultra-resistant to fraud.

It is meant to be used against delinquant governments which doesn't hesitate
to rig elections to stay in power.


## 1. **Techniques used to rig elections**

### **A. Manipulation Before Election Day**

* **Tampering with the voter registry**: adding fake names or deleting real voters to influence turnout.
* **Unequal distribution of voter cards**: withholding or distributing cards only to supporters of the ruling party.
* **Gerrymandering** (partisan redistricting): changing voting district boundaries to benefit one party.

### **B. Manipulation During Voting**

* **Ballot stuffing**: adding extra ballots to the box by corrupt election officials.
* **Multiple voting**: the same person voting several times using different identities.
* **Voter intimidation**: presence of militias or armed forces at polling stations to influence or discourage certain voters.
* **Physical prevention of voting**: early closing of polling stations, late openings, or lack of electoral materials in targeted areas.
* **Abusive proxy voting**: illegal use of votes for absent or deceased persons.

### **C. Manipulation During Counting and Transmission**

* **Falsifying tally sheets**: altering figures when transferring results to central authorities.
* **Rigged software**: tampering with electronic voting or counting systems to favor a candidate.
* **Inflated or reduced results**: adding or removing votes during final calculation.
* **Blocking or hiding local results**: delaying announcement of certain areas to prepare a falsified “official” version.

### **D. Indirect Influence Strategies**

* **Vote buying**: distributing money, gifts, or promises in exchange for votes.
* **Disproportionate propaganda**: exclusive access to state media, smear campaigns against opponents.
* **Using state apparatus**: public resources used to promote one candidate.

## 2. **Practical Measures Citizens Can Take to Prevent and Monitor Elections**

### **A. Before the Election**

1. **Citizen audit of the voter registry**

   * Local committees verify that every citizen is correctly registered.
   * Public reporting of anomalies (fake names, missing voters, duplicates).
2. **Training election observers**

   * Volunteers trained on official voting and counting procedures.
   * Collaboration with NGOs and international observers.

### **B. On Election Day**

1. **Mass presence of independent observers**

   * Independent monitors in each polling station.
   * Video recording or live monitoring (where legally possible).
2. **Transparency in the process**

   * Public display of voter lists at the entrance.
   * Counting ballots in front of witnesses.
3. **Real-time incident reporting**

   * Secure apps to report irregularities (photos, videos, testimonies).

### **C. After the Vote**

1. **Verification of tally sheets**

   * Each polling station publicly posts its results before transmission.
   * Comparison of local copies with official announced results.
2. **Citizen-based result centralization**

   * Collaborative platforms for publishing and comparing observer-collected results.
3. **Protection against digital tampering**

   * Independent audits of counting software and secure storage of data.

### **D. Public & Legal Pressure**

* Civil society mobilization to demand full, detailed results by polling station.
* Legal action and media exposure when documented fraud is found.

## 3. **Which points UFRECS solve?**

UFRECS solve the methods used during the elections day and after.

### **B. On Election Day**

1. **Mass presence of independent observers**

The citizens are confident on the control app and they are certain they can use it
without infriging the law.

2. **Transparency in the process**

The reporters can publicly take account of their observation.
The app and the backend code sources are open source and can be checked.
Many people can report for the same vote's office. Thus increasing the transparency.

3. **Real-time incident reporting**

The app reports the deballing in real time. The voting process can also be livestreamed.
The couting of voting happens in real time so the confidence of the voters increase.

### **C. After the Vote**

Because the couting was in real time, at the end of the couting the results are known.
The different reports can be compared by voting office in case of discrepancies.
Those people who are in zones with no network to live-sync the counting can
move rapidly to zone covered by a network a let the sync happen.

All these videos, audios and reports can be presented as proof in case
any wrong results are presented.
